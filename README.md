## Installation
SpiritSoft is distributed in two ways: a web version and a desktop app. You should use the web
version if you are a school and want multiple users to access the app, and the desktop app if you
are a single teacher with a small number of students.

The main difference between them is that the web version can be accessed by multiple users at the
same time and is run on a central school server, whereas the desktop version runs on a single
computer. Apart from this, the feature set of both versions are the same.

### Desktop App
Download the latest version [here](https://github.com/jdabtieu/fbla2023/releases). Extract the
zip file to a folder of your choosing, and once it's complete, you can launch SpiritSoft by double
clicking the SpiritSoft app.


### Web Version
To install the web version, please [email us](jonathan.wu3@outlook.com) to set it up in a secure
configuration for your school or school district.
